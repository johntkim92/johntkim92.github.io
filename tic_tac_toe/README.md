## Technologies used
- I used html, css, javascript, and jquery for my tic tac toe game. Implementing the styling through css and getting it to looks the way I wanted was probably the most fun part of the project.

## Approach Taken
- As seen in my wireframe images, I like to write out what I think will be necessary in terms of javascript. What objects I will need and what functions will be stored in them to get the game running properly. I then like to think about each step needed to run the game, and how those steps will react to come up with the next step and then I can split those steps into different functions. My approach is always getting the basic framework down on html by creating the necessary headings and divs just so that I can visualize what goes where. I then styled my html elements first to get the tic tac toe board on the page. Then I started writing out the javascript. After the javascript was done and the game worked, I spent more time on css to get the game page to look nice.

## Unsolved problems
- I did not get my javascript code to look good at all. I have over 300 lines of code and I know I couldve written it to be 100-200 lines. If I had more time, I would go back and make the code easier to read and more presentable. I also didn't know how to turn the on-clicks back on after having turned them off. If I figured that out, I would have been able to keep a tally of player wins.
